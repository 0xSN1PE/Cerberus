The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order to test the systemâ€™s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so,  they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them. Here are some useful resources.""",
